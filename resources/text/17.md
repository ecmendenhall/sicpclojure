## [2.4  Multiple Representations for Abstract
Data](contents.html#sec_2.4)

We have introduced data abstraction, a methodology for structuring systems in
such a way that much of a program can be specified independent of the choices
involved in implementing the data objects that the program manipulates. For
example, we saw in section [2.1.1](book-Z-H-14.html#%_sec_2.1.1) how to
separate the task of designing a program that uses rational numbers from the
task of implementing rational numbers in terms of the computer language's
primitive mechanisms for constructing compound data. The key idea was to erect
an abstraction barrier -- in this case, the selectors and constructors for
rational numbers (`make-rat`, `numer`, `denom`) -- that isolates the way
rational numbers are used from their underlying representation in terms of
list structure. A similar abstraction barrier isolates the details of the
procedures that perform rational arithmetic (`add-rat`, `sub-rat`, `mul-rat`,
and `div-rat`) from the ``higher-level'' procedures that use rational numbers.
The resulting program has the structure shown in figure
[2.1](book-Z-H-14.html#%_fig_2.1).

These data-abstraction barriers are powerful tools for controlling complexity.
By isolating the underlying representations of data objects, we can divide the
task of designing a large program into smaller tasks that can be performed
separately. But this kind of data abstraction is not yet powerful enough,
because it may not always make sense to speak of ``the underlying
representation'' for a data object.

For one thing, there might be more than one useful representation for a data
object, and we might like to design systems that can deal with multiple
representations. To take a simple example, complex numbers may be represented
in two almost equivalent ways: in rectangular form (real and imaginary parts)
and in polar form (magnitude and angle). Sometimes rectangular form is more
appropriate and sometimes polar form is more appropriate. Indeed, it is
perfectly plausible to imagine a system in which complex numbers are
represented in both ways, and in which the procedures for manipulating complex
numbers work with either representation.

More importantly, programming systems are often designed by many people
working over extended periods of time, subject to requirements that change
over time. In such an environment, it is simply not possible for everyone to
agree in advance on choices of data representation. So in addition to the
data-abstraction barriers that isolate representation from use, we need
abstraction barriers that isolate different design choices from each other and
permit different choices to coexist in a single program. Furthermore, since
large programs are often created by combining pre-existing modules that were
designed in isolation, we need conventions that permit programmers to
incorporate modules into larger systems _additively_, that is, without having
to redesign or reimplement these modules.

In this section, we will learn how to cope with data that may be represented
in different ways by different parts of a program. This requires constructing
_generic procedures_ \-- procedures that can operate on data that may be
represented in more than one way. Our main technique for building generic
procedures will be to work in terms of data objects that have _type tags_,
that is, data objects that include explicit information about how they are to
be processed. We will also discuss _data-directed_ programming, a powerful and
convenient implementation strategy for additively assembling systems with
generic operations.

We begin with the simple complex-number example. We will see how type tags and
data-directed style enable us to design separate rectangular and polar
representations for complex numbers while maintaining the notion of an
abstract ``complex-number'' data object. We will accomplish this by defining
arithmetic procedures for complex numbers (`add-complex`, `sub-complex`, `mul-
complex`, and `div-complex`) in terms of generic selectors that access parts
of a complex number independent of how the number is represented. The
resulting complex-number system, as shown in figure 2.19, contains two
different kinds of abstraction barriers. The ``horizontal'' abstraction
barriers play the same role as the ones in figure
[2.1](book-Z-H-14.html#%_fig_2.1). They isolate ``higher-level'' operations
from ``lower-level'' representations. In addition, there is a ``vertical''
barrier that gives us the ability to separately design and install alternative
representations.

**Figure 2.19:**  Data-abstraction barriers in the complex-number system.

In section [2.5](book-Z-H-18.html#%_sec_2.5) we will show how to use type tags
and data-directed style to develop a generic arithmetic package. This provides
procedures (`add`, `mul`, and so on) that can be used to manipulate all sorts
of ``numbers'' and can be easily extended when a new kind of number is needed.
In section [2.5.3](book-Z-H-18.html#%_sec_2.5.3), we'll show how to use
generic arithmetic in a system that performs symbolic algebra.

### [2.4.1  Representations for Complex
Numbers](contents.html#sec_2.4.1)

We will develop a system that performs arithmetic operations on complex
numbers as a simple but unrealistic example of a program that uses generic
operations. We begin by discussing two plausible representations for complex
numbers as ordered pairs: rectangular form (real part and imaginary part) and
polar form (magnitude and angle).43 Section 2.4.2 will show how both
representations can be made to coexist in a single system through the use of
type tags and generic operations.

Like rational numbers, complex numbers are naturally represented as ordered
pairs. The set of complex numbers can be thought of as a two-dimensional space
with two orthogonal axes, the ``real'' axis and the ``imaginary'' axis. (See
figure 2.20.) From this point of view, the complex number _z_ = _x_ \+ _i__y_
(where _i_2 = - 1) can be thought of as the point in the plane whose real
coordinate is _x_ and whose imaginary coordinate is _y_. Addition of complex
numbers reduces in this representation to addition of coordinates:

![](ch2-Z-G-55.gif)

![](ch2-Z-G-56.gif)

When multiplying complex numbers, it is more natural to think in terms of
representing a complex number in polar form, as a magnitude and an angle (_r_
and _A_ in figure 2.20). The product of two complex numbers is the vector
obtained by stretching one complex number by the length of the other and then
rotating it through the angle of the other:

![](ch2-Z-G-57.gif)

![](ch2-Z-G-58.gif)

Thus, there are two different representations for complex numbers, which are
appropriate for different operations. Yet, from the viewpoint of someone
writing a program that uses complex numbers, the principle of data abstraction
suggests that all the operations for manipulating complex numbers should be
available regardless of which representation is used by the computer. For
example, it is often useful to be able to find the magnitude of a complex
number that is specified by rectangular coordinates. Similarly, it is often
useful to be able to determine the real part of a complex number that is
specified by polar coordinates.

![](ch2-Z-G-59.gif)

**Figure 2.20:**  Complex numbers as points in the plane.

To design such a system, we can follow the same data-abstraction strategy we
followed in designing the rational-number package in section
[2.1.1](book-Z-H-14.html#%_sec_2.1.1). Assume that the operations on complex
numbers are implemented in terms of four selectors: `real-part`, `imag-part`,
`magnitude`, and `angle`. Also assume that we have two procedures for
constructing complex numbers: `make-from-real-imag` returns a complex number
with specified real and imaginary parts, and `make-from-mag-ang` returns a
complex number with specified magnitude and angle. These procedures have the
property that, for any complex number `z`, both

`(make-from-real-imag (real-part z) (imag-part z))  
`

and

`(make-from-mag-ang (magnitude z) (angle z))  
`

produce complex numbers that are equal to `z`.

Using these constructors and selectors, we can implement arithmetic on complex
numbers using the ``abstract data'' specified by the constructors and
selectors, just as we did for rational numbers in section
[2.1.1](book-Z-H-14.html#%_sec_2.1.1). As shown in the formulas above, we can
add and subtract complex numbers in terms of real and imaginary parts while
multiplying and dividing complex numbers in terms of magnitudes and angles:

`(define (add-complex z1 z2)  
  (make-from-real-imag (+ (real-part z1) (real-part z2))  
                       (+ (imag-part z1) (imag-part z2))))  
(define (sub-complex z1 z2)  
  (make-from-real-imag (- (real-part z1) (real-part z2))  
                       (- (imag-part z1) (imag-part z2))))  
(define (mul-complex z1 z2)  
  (make-from-mag-ang (* (magnitude z1) (magnitude z2))  
                     (+ (angle z1) (angle z2))))  
(define (div-complex z1 z2)  
  (make-from-mag-ang (/ (magnitude z1) (magnitude z2))  
                     (- (angle z1) (angle z2))))  
`

To complete the complex-number package, we must choose a representation and we
must implement the constructors and selectors in terms of primitive numbers
and primitive list structure. There are two obvious ways to do this: We can
represent a complex number in ``rectangular form'' as a pair (real part,
imaginary part) or in ``polar form'' as a pair (magnitude, angle). Which shall
we choose?

In order to make the different choices concrete, imagine that there are two
programmers, Ben Bitdiddle and Alyssa P. Hacker, who are independently
designing representations for the complex-number system. Ben chooses to
represent complex numbers in rectangular form. With this choice, selecting the
real and imaginary parts of a complex number is straightforward, as is
constructing a complex number with given real and imaginary parts. To find the
magnitude and the angle, or to construct a complex number with a given
magnitude and angle, he uses the trigonometric relations

![](ch2-Z-G-60.gif)

![](ch2-Z-G-61.gif)

which relate the real and imaginary parts (_x_, _y_) to the magnitude and the
angle (_r_, _A_).44 Ben's representation is therefore given by the following
selectors and constructors:

`(define (real-part z) (car z))  
(define (imag-part z) (cdr z))  
(define (magnitude z)  
  (sqrt (+ (square (real-part z)) (square (imag-part z)))))  
(define (angle z)  
  (atan (imag-part z) (real-part z)))  
(define (make-from-real-imag x y) (cons x y))  
(define (make-from-mag-ang r a)  
  (cons (* r (cos a)) (* r (sin a))))  
`

Alyssa, in contrast, chooses to represent complex numbers in polar form. For
her, selecting the magnitude and angle is straightforward, but she has to use
the trigonometric relations to obtain the real and imaginary parts. Alyssa's
representation is:

`(define (real-part z)  
  (* (magnitude z) (cos (angle z))))  
(define (imag-part z)  
  (* (magnitude z) (sin (angle z))))  
(define (magnitude z) (car z))  
(define (angle z) (cdr z))  
(define (make-from-real-imag x y)  
  (cons (sqrt (+ (square x) (square y)))  
        (atan y x)))  
(define (make-from-mag-ang r a) (cons r a))  
`

The discipline of data abstraction ensures that the same implementation of
`add-complex`, `sub-complex`, `mul-complex`, and `div-complex` will work with
either Ben's representation or Alyssa's representation.

### [2.4.2  Tagged data](contents.html#sec_2.4.2)

One way to view data abstraction is as an application of the ``principle of
least commitment.'' In implementing the complex-number system in section
2.4.1, we can use either Ben's rectangular representation or Alyssa's polar
representation. The abstraction barrier formed by the selectors and
constructors permits us to defer to the last possible moment the choice of a
concrete representation for our data objects and thus retain maximum
flexibility in our system design.

The principle of least commitment can be carried to even further extremes. If
we desire, we can maintain the ambiguity of representation even _after_ we
have designed the selectors and constructors, and elect to use both Ben's
representation _and_ Alyssa's representation. If both representations are
included in a single system, however, we will need some way to distinguish
data in polar form from data in rectangular form. Otherwise, if we were asked,
for instance, to find the `magnitude` of the pair (3,4), we wouldn't know
whether to answer 5 (interpreting the number in rectangular form) or 3
(interpreting the number in polar form). A straightforward way to accomplish
this distinction is to include a _type tag_ \-- the symbol `rectangular` or
`polar` \-- as part of each complex number. Then when we need to manipulate a
complex number we can use the tag to decide which selector to apply.

In order to manipulate tagged data, we will assume that we have procedures
`type-tag` and `contents` that extract from a data object the tag and the
actual contents (the polar or rectangular coordinates, in the case of a
complex number). We will also postulate a procedure `attach-tag` that takes a
tag and contents and produces a tagged data object. A straightforward way to
implement this is to use ordinary list structure:

`(define (attach-tag type-tag contents)  
  (cons type-tag contents))  
(define (type-tag datum)  
  (if (pair? datum)  
      (car datum)  
      (error "Bad tagged datum \-- TYPE-TAG" datum)))  
(define (contents datum)  
  (if (pair? datum)  
      (cdr datum)  
      (error "Bad tagged datum \-- CONTENTS" datum)))  
`

Using these procedures, we can define predicates `rectangular?` and `polar?`,
which recognize polar and rectangular numbers, respectively:

`(define (rectangular? z)  
  (eq? (type-tag z) 'rectangular))  
(define (polar? z)  
  (eq? (type-tag z) 'polar))  
`

With type tags, Ben and Alyssa can now modify their code so that their two
different representations can coexist in the same system. Whenever Ben
constructs a complex number, he tags it as rectangular. Whenever Alyssa
constructs a complex number, she tags it as polar. In addition, Ben and Alyssa
must make sure that the names of their procedures do not conflict. One way to
do this is for Ben to append the suffix `rectangular` to the name of each of
his representation procedures and for Alyssa to append `polar` to the names of
hers. Here is Ben's revised rectangular representation from section 2.4.1:

`(define (real-part-rectangular z) (car z))  
(define (imag-part-rectangular z) (cdr z))  
(define (magnitude-rectangular z)  
  (sqrt (+ (square (real-part-rectangular z))  
           (square (imag-part-rectangular z)))))  
(define (angle-rectangular z)  
  (atan (imag-part-rectangular z)  
        (real-part-rectangular z)))  
(define (make-from-real-imag-rectangular x y)  
  (attach-tag 'rectangular (cons x y)))  
(define (make-from-mag-ang-rectangular r a)  
  (attach-tag 'rectangular  
              (cons (* r (cos a)) (* r (sin a)))))  
`

and here is Alyssa's revised polar representation:

`(define (real-part-polar z)  
  (* (magnitude-polar z) (cos (angle-polar z))))  
(define (imag-part-polar z)  
  (* (magnitude-polar z) (sin (angle-polar z))))  
(define (magnitude-polar z) (car z))  
(define (angle-polar z) (cdr z))  
(define (make-from-real-imag-polar x y)  
  (attach-tag 'polar  
               (cons (sqrt (+ (square x) (square y)))  
                     (atan y x))))  
(define (make-from-mag-ang-polar r a)  
  (attach-tag 'polar (cons r a)))  
`

Each generic selector is implemented as a procedure that checks the tag of its
argument and calls the appropriate procedure for handling data of that type.
For example, to obtain the real part of a complex number, `real-part` examines
the tag to determine whether to use Ben's `real-part-rectangular` or Alyssa's
`real-part-polar`. In either case, we use `contents` to extract the bare,
untagged datum and send this to the rectangular or polar procedure as
required:

`(define (real-part z)  
  (cond ((rectangular? z)  
         (real-part-rectangular (contents z)))  
        ((polar? z)  
         (real-part-polar (contents z)))  
        (else (error "Unknown type \-- REAL-PART" z))))  
(define (imag-part z)  
  (cond ((rectangular? z)  
         (imag-part-rectangular (contents z)))  
        ((polar? z)  
         (imag-part-polar (contents z)))  
        (else (error "Unknown type \-- IMAG-PART" z))))  
(define (magnitude z)  
  (cond ((rectangular? z)  
         (magnitude-rectangular (contents z)))  
        ((polar? z)  
         (magnitude-polar (contents z)))  
        (else (error "Unknown type \-- MAGNITUDE" z))))  
(define (angle z)  
  (cond ((rectangular? z)  
         (angle-rectangular (contents z)))  
        ((polar? z)  
         (angle-polar (contents z)))  
        (else (error "Unknown type \-- ANGLE" z))))  
`

To implement the complex-number arithmetic operations, we can use the same
procedures `add-complex`, `sub-complex`, `mul-complex`, and `div-complex` from
section 2.4.1, because the selectors they call are generic, and so will work
with either representation. For example, the procedure `add-complex` is still

`(define (add-complex z1 z2)  
  (make-from-real-imag (+ (real-part z1) (real-part z2))  
                       (+ (imag-part z1) (imag-part z2))))  
`

Finally, we must choose whether to construct complex numbers using Ben's
representation or Alyssa's representation. One reasonable choice is to
construct rectangular numbers whenever we have real and imaginary parts and to
construct polar numbers whenever we have magnitudes and angles:

`(define (make-from-real-imag x y)  
  (make-from-real-imag-rectangular x y))  
(define (make-from-mag-ang r a)  
  (make-from-mag-ang-polar r a))  
`

**Figure 2.21:**  Structure of the generic complex-arithmetic system.

The resulting complex-number system has the structure shown in figure 2.21.
The system has been decomposed into three relatively independent parts: the
complex-number-arithmetic operations, Alyssa's polar implementation, and Ben's
rectangular implementation. The polar and rectangular implementations could
have been written by Ben and Alyssa working separately, and both of these can
be used as underlying representations by a third programmer implementing the
complex-arithmetic procedures in terms of the abstract constructor/selector
interface.

Since each data object is tagged with its type, the selectors operate on the
data in a generic manner. That is, each selector is defined to have a behavior
that depends upon the particular type of data it is applied to. Notice the
general mechanism for interfacing the separate representations: Within a given
representation implementation (say, Alyssa's polar package) a complex number
is an untyped pair (magnitude, angle). When a generic selector operates on a
number of `polar` type, it strips off the tag and passes the contents on to
Alyssa's code. Conversely, when Alyssa constructs a number for general use,
she tags it with a type so that it can be appropriately recognized by the
higher-level procedures. This discipline of stripping off and attaching tags
as data objects are passed from level to level can be an important
organizational strategy, as we shall see in section
[2.5](book-Z-H-18.html#%_sec_2.5).

### [2.4.3  Data-Directed Programming and
Additivity](contents.html#sec_2.4.3)

The general strategy of checking the type of a datum and calling an
appropriate procedure is called _dispatching on type_. This is a powerful
strategy for obtaining modularity in system design. On the other hand,
implementing the dispatch as in section 2.4.2 has two significant weaknesses.
One weakness is that the generic interface procedures (`real-part`, `imag-
part`, `magnitude`, and `angle`) must know about all the different
representations. For instance, suppose we wanted to incorporate a new
representation for complex numbers into our complex-number system. We would
need to identify this new representation with a type, and then add a clause to
each of the generic interface procedures to check for the new type and apply
the appropriate selector for that representation.

Another weakness of the technique is that even though the individual
representations can be designed separately, we must guarantee that no two
procedures in the entire system have the same name. This is why Ben and Alyssa
had to change the names of their original procedures from section 2.4.1.

The issue underlying both of these weaknesses is that the technique for
implementing generic interfaces is not _additive_. The person implementing the
generic selector procedures must modify those procedures each time a new
representation is installed, and the people interfacing the individual
representations must modify their code to avoid name conflicts. In each of
these cases, the changes that must be made to the code are straightforward,
but they must be made nonetheless, and this is a source of inconvenience and
error. This is not much of a problem for the complex-number system as it
stands, but suppose there were not two but hundreds of different
representations for complex numbers. And suppose that there were many generic
selectors to be maintained in the abstract-data interface. Suppose, in fact,
that no one programmer knew all the interface procedures or all the
representations. The problem is real and must be addressed in such programs as
large-scale data-base-management systems.

What we need is a means for modularizing the system design even further. This
is provided by the programming technique known as _data-directed programming_.
To understand how data-directed programming works, begin with the observation
that whenever we deal with a set of generic operations that are common to a
set of different types we are, in effect, dealing with a two-dimensional table
that contains the possible operations on one axis and the possible types on
the other axis. The entries in the table are the procedures that implement
each operation for each type of argument presented. In the complex-number
system developed in the previous section, the correspondence between operation
name, data type, and actual procedure was spread out among the various
conditional clauses in the generic interface procedures. But the same
information could have been organized in a table, as shown in figure 2.22.

Data-directed programming is the technique of designing programs to work with
such a table directly. Previously, we implemented the mechanism that
interfaces the complex-arithmetic code with the two representation packages as
a set of procedures that each perform an explicit dispatch on type. Here we
will implement the interface as a single procedure that looks up the
combination of the operation name and argument type in the table to find the
correct procedure to apply, and then applies it to the contents of the
argument. If we do this, then to add a new representation package to the
system we need not change any existing procedures; we need only add new
entries to the table.

![](ch2-Z-G-63.gif)

**Figure 2.22:**  Table of operations for the complex-number system.

To implement this plan, assume that we have two procedures, `put` and `get`,
for manipulating the operation-and-type table:

  * `(put <_op_> <_type_> <_item_>)`  
installs the `<_item_>` in the table, indexed by the `<_op_>` and the
`<_type_>`.

  * `(get <_op_> <_type_>)`  
looks up the `<_op_>`, `<_type_>` entry in the table and returns the item
found there. If no item is found, `get` returns false.

For now, we can assume that `put` and `get` are included in our language. In
chapter 3 (section [3.3.3](book-Z-H-22.html#%_sec_3.3.3), exercise
[3.24](book-Z-H-22.html#%_thm_3.24)) we will see how to implement these and
other operations for manipulating tables.

Here is how data-directed programming can be used in the complex-number
system. Ben, who developed the rectangular representation, implements his code
just as he did originally. He defines a collection of procedures, or a
_package_, and interfaces these to the rest of the system by adding entries to
the table that tell the system how to operate on rectangular numbers. This is
accomplished by calling the following procedure:

`(define (install-rectangular-package)  
  _;; internal procedures_  
  (define (real-part z) (car z))  
  (define (imag-part z) (cdr z))  
  (define (make-from-real-imag x y) (cons x y))  
  (define (magnitude z)  
    (sqrt (+ (square (real-part z))  
             (square (imag-part z)))))  
  (define (angle z)  
    (atan (imag-part z) (real-part z)))  
  (define (make-from-mag-ang r a)  
    (cons (* r (cos a)) (* r (sin a))))  
  _;; interface to the rest of the system_  
  (define (tag x) (attach-tag 'rectangular x))  
  (put 'real-part '(rectangular) real-part)  
  (put 'imag-part '(rectangular) imag-part)  
  (put 'magnitude '(rectangular) magnitude)  
  (put 'angle '(rectangular) angle)  
  (put 'make-from-real-imag 'rectangular  
       (lambda (x y) (tag (make-from-real-imag x y))))  
  (put 'make-from-mag-ang 'rectangular  
       (lambda (r a) (tag (make-from-mag-ang r a))))  
  'done)  
`

Notice that the internal procedures here are the same procedures from section
2.4.1 that Ben wrote when he was working in isolation. No changes are
necessary in order to interface them to the rest of the system. Moreover,
since these procedure definitions are internal to the installation procedure,
Ben needn't worry about name conflicts with other procedures outside the
rectangular package. To interface these to the rest of the system, Ben
installs his `real-part` procedure under the operation name `real-part` and
the type `(rectangular)`, and similarly for the other selectors.45 The
interface also defines the constructors to be used by the external system.46
These are identical to Ben's internally defined constructors, except that they
attach the tag.

Alyssa's polar package is analogous:

`(define (install-polar-package)  
  _;; internal procedures_  
  (define (magnitude z) (car z))  
  (define (angle z) (cdr z))  
  (define (make-from-mag-ang r a) (cons r a))  
  (define (real-part z)  
    (* (magnitude z) (cos (angle z))))  
  (define (imag-part z)  
    (* (magnitude z) (sin (angle z))))  
  (define (make-from-real-imag x y)  
    (cons (sqrt (+ (square x) (square y)))  
          (atan y x)))  
  _;; interface to the rest of the system_  
  (define (tag x) (attach-tag 'polar x))  
  (put 'real-part '(polar) real-part)  
  (put 'imag-part '(polar) imag-part)  
  (put 'magnitude '(polar) magnitude)  
  (put 'angle '(polar) angle)  
  (put 'make-from-real-imag 'polar  
       (lambda (x y) (tag (make-from-real-imag x y))))  
  (put 'make-from-mag-ang 'polar  
       (lambda (r a) (tag (make-from-mag-ang r a))))  
  'done)  
`

Even though Ben and Alyssa both still use their original procedures defined
with the same names as each other's (e.g., `real-part`), these definitions are
now internal to different procedures (see section
[1.1.8](book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1.8)), so there is no name conflict.

The complex-arithmetic selectors access the table by means of a general
``operation'' procedure called `apply-generic`, which applies a generic
operation to some arguments. `Apply-generic` looks in the table under the name
of the operation and the types of the arguments and applies the resulting
procedure if one is present:47

`(define (apply-generic op . args)  
  (let ((type-tags (map type-tag args)))  
    (let ((proc (get op type-tags)))  
      (if proc  
          (apply proc (map contents args))  
          (error  
            "No method for these types \-- APPLY-GENERIC"  
            (list op type-tags))))))  
`

Using `apply-generic`, we can define our generic selectors as follows:

`(define (real-part z) (apply-generic 'real-part z))  
(define (imag-part z) (apply-generic 'imag-part z))  
(define (magnitude z) (apply-generic 'magnitude z))  
(define (angle z) (apply-generic 'angle z))  
`

Observe that these do not change at all if a new representation is added to
the system.

We can also extract from the table the constructors to be used by the programs
external to the packages in making complex numbers from real and imaginary
parts and from magnitudes and angles. As in section 2.4.2, we construct
rectangular numbers whenever we have real and imaginary parts, and polar
numbers whenever we have magnitudes and angles:

`(define (make-from-real-imag x y)  
  ((get 'make-from-real-imag 'rectangular) x y))  
(define (make-from-mag-ang r a)  
  ((get 'make-from-mag-ang 'polar) r a))  
`

**Exercise 2.73.**  Section [2.3.2](book-Z-H-16.html#%_sec_2.3.2) described a program that performs symbolic differentiation: 

`(define (deriv exp var)  
  (cond ((number? exp) 0)  
        ((variable? exp) (if (same-variable? exp var) 1 0))  
        ((sum? exp)  
         (make-sum (deriv (addend exp) var)  
                   (deriv (augend exp) var)))  
        ((product? exp)  
         (make-sum  
           (make-product (multiplier exp)  
                         (deriv (multiplicand exp) var))  
           (make-product (deriv (multiplier exp) var)  
                         (multiplicand exp))))  
        <_more rules can be added here_>  
        (else (error "unknown expression type \-- DERIV" exp))))  
`

We can regard this program as performing a dispatch on the type of the
expression to be differentiated. In this situation the ``type tag'' of the
datum is the algebraic operator symbol (such as `+`) and the operation being
performed is `deriv`. We can transform this program into data-directed style
by rewriting the basic derivative procedure as

`(define (deriv exp var)  
   (cond ((number? exp) 0)  
         ((variable? exp) (if (same-variable? exp var) 1 0))  
         (else ((get 'deriv (operator exp)) (operands exp)  
                                            var))))  
(define (operator exp) (car exp))  
(define (operands exp) (cdr exp))  
`

a.  Explain what was done above. Why can't we assimilate the predicates
`number?` and `same-variable?` into the data-directed dispatch?

b.  Write the procedures for derivatives of sums and products, and the
auxiliary code required to install them in the table used by the program
above.

c.  Choose any additional differentiation rule that you like, such as the one
for exponents (exercise [2.56](book-Z-H-16.html#%_thm_2.56)), and install it
in this data-directed system.

d.  In this simple algebraic manipulator the type of an expression is the
algebraic operator that binds it together. Suppose, however, we indexed the
procedures in the opposite way, so that the dispatch line in `deriv` looked
like

`((get (operator exp) 'deriv) (operands exp) var)  
`

What corresponding changes to the derivative system are required?

**Exercise 2.74.**  Insatiable Enterprises, Inc., is a highly decentralized conglomerate company consisting of a large number of independent divisions located all over the world. The company's computer facilities have just been interconnected by means of a clever network-interfacing scheme that makes the entire network appear to any user to be a single computer. Insatiable's president, in her first attempt to exploit the ability of the network to extract administrative information from division files, is dismayed to discover that, although all the division files have been implemented as data structures in Scheme, the particular data structure used varies from division to division. A meeting of division managers is hastily called to search for a strategy to integrate the files that will satisfy headquarters' needs while preserving the existing autonomy of the divisions.

Show how such a strategy can be implemented with data-directed programming. As
an example, suppose that each division's personnel records consist of a single
file, which contains a set of records keyed on employees' names. The structure
of the set varies from division to division. Furthermore, each employee's
record is itself a set (structured differently from division to division) that
contains information keyed under identifiers such as `address` and `salary`.
In particular:

a.  Implement for headquarters a `get-record` procedure that retrieves a
specified employee's record from a specified personnel file. The procedure
should be applicable to any division's file. Explain how the individual
divisions' files should be structured. In particular, what type information
must be supplied?

b.  Implement for headquarters a `get-salary` procedure that returns the
salary information from a given employee's record from any division's
personnel file. How should the record be structured in order to make this
operation work?

c.  Implement for headquarters a `find-employee-record` procedure. This should
search all the divisions' files for the record of a given employee and return
the record. Assume that this procedure takes as arguments an employee's name
and a list of all the divisions' files.

d.  When Insatiable takes over a new company, what changes must be made in
order to incorporate the new personnel information into the central system?

#### [Message passing](book-Z-H-4.html#sec_Temp_275)

The key idea of data-directed programming is to handle generic operations in
programs by dealing explicitly with operation-and-type tables, such as the
table in figure 2.22. The style of programming we used in section 2.4.2
organized the required dispatching on type by having each operation take care
of its own dispatching. In effect, this decomposes the operation-and-type
table into rows, with each generic operation procedure representing a row of
the table.

An alternative implementation strategy is to decompose the table into columns
and, instead of using ``intelligent operations'' that dispatch on data types,
to work with ``intelligent data objects'' that dispatch on operation names. We
can do this by arranging things so that a data object, such as a rectangular
number, is represented as a procedure that takes as input the required
operation name and performs the operation indicated. In such a discipline,
`make-from-real-imag` could be written as

`(define (make-from-real-imag x y)  
  (define (dispatch op)  
    (cond ((eq? op 'real-part) x)  
          ((eq? op 'imag-part) y)  
          ((eq? op 'magnitude)  
           (sqrt (+ (square x) (square y))))  
          ((eq? op 'angle) (atan y x))  
          (else  
           (error "Unknown op \-- MAKE-FROM-REAL-IMAG" op))))  
  dispatch)  
`

The corresponding `apply-generic` procedure, which applies a generic operation
to an argument, now simply feeds the operation's name to the data object and
lets the object do the work:48

`(define (apply-generic op arg) (arg op))  
`

Note that the value returned by `make-from-real-imag` is a procedure -- the
internal `dispatch` procedure. This is the procedure that is invoked when
`apply-generic` requests an operation to be performed.

This style of programming is called _message passing_. The name comes from the
image that a data object is an entity that receives the requested operation
name as a ``message.'' We have already seen an example of message passing in
section [2.1.3](book-Z-H-14.html#%_sec_2.1.3), where we saw how `cons`, `car`,
and `cdr` could be defined with no data objects but only procedures. Here we
see that message passing is not a mathematical trick but a useful technique
for organizing systems with generic operations. In the remainder of this
chapter we will continue to use data-directed programming, rather than message
passing, to discuss generic arithmetic operations. In chapter 3 we will return
to message passing, and we will see that it can be a powerful tool for
structuring simulation programs.

**Exercise 2.75.**  Implement the constructor `make-from-mag-ang` in message-passing style. This procedure should be analogous to the `make-from-real-imag` procedure given above. 

**Exercise 2.76.**  As a large system with generic operations evolves, new types of data objects or new operations may be needed. For each of the three strategies -- generic operations with explicit dispatch, data-directed style, and message-passing-style -- describe the changes that must be made to a system in order to add new types or new operations. Which organization would be most appropriate for a system in which new types must often be added? Which would be most appropriate for a system in which new operations must often be added?

43 In actual computational systems, rectangular form is preferable to polar
form most of the time because of roundoff errors in conversion between
rectangular and polar form. This is why the complex-number example is
unrealistic. Nevertheless, it provides a clear illustration of the design of a
system using generic operations and a good introduction to the more
substantial systems to be developed later in this chapter.

44 The arctangent function referred to here, computed by Scheme's `atan`
procedure, is defined so as to take two arguments _y_ and _x_ and to return
the angle whose tangent is _y_/_x_. The signs of the arguments determine the
quadrant of the angle.

45 We use the list `(rectangular)` rather than the symbol `rectangular` to
allow for the possibility of operations with multiple arguments, not all of
the same type.

46 The type the constructors are installed under needn't be a list because a
constructor is always used to make an object of one particular type.

47 `Apply-generic` uses the dotted-tail notation described in exercise
[2.20](book-Z-H-15.html#%_thm_2.20), because different generic operations may
take different numbers of arguments. In `apply-generic`, `op` has as its value
the first argument to `apply-generic` and `args` has as its value a list of
the remaining arguments.

`Apply-generic` also uses the primitive procedure `apply`, which takes two
arguments, a procedure and a list. `Apply` applies the procedure, using the
elements in the list as arguments. For example,

`(apply + (list 1 2 3 4))  
`

returns 10.

48 One limitation of this organization is it permits only generic procedures
of one argument.
